      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A chipper gal with a positive attitude, I am an eager student just waiting to emabark on this coding journey with my classmates :D</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in the HK but grew up in the sunshine state of USA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love doing all things creative & also getting outdoors to enjoy that sunshine!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Keeping in line with my desire to take this course, my current dream job is to become a full stack web developer; failing that, I'd be equally happy being an animal caretaker :3</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Being a beach gal, of course I'd be residing in the Northern Beaches of Sydney!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always been fascinated with the IT industry and been curious with learning full stack web development. To be able to build the infrastucture of a website and design the outward look & feel is all very exciting to me!</p>
